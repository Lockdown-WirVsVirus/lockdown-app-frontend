## About the project

The idea of safeticket is to provide an easy and convient way to create verifiable documents when going out in case of a lockdown. The term "ticket" stands for a digitalized document with the information of where and how long you want to go outside. It is linked to your personal identification document (e.g. passport) but the system and its servers only store a hash of it. There is no observations of the users.
